The Mistriotis lab is excited to attend the [BMES 2022 Conference](https://www.bmes.org/annualmeeting)! Our graduate student Farnaz Hemmati gave an oral presentation on her work on cell entrapment in confined microenvironments with the title: 'A novel microfluidic device for investigating the long-term effects of confinement on cell phenotype and function'. Congratulations Farnaz!
