We are delighted to share our new work, now published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), showing that elevated viscosity counterintuitively increases cell motility and imprints mechanical memory in tumor cells enabling them to disseminate more efficiently in vivo. Find the publication [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05394-6).
