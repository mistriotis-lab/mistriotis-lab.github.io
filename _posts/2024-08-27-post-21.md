We are excited to share that on August 27, 2024, Farshad Amiri successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation!

His relentless effort and commitment to research during his time at our Lab have truly come to fruition, and we couldnâ€™t be more proud of him. 

Adding to the celebration, his first-author publication entitled ["Confinement controls the directional cell responses to fluid forces"](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01043-X) providing novel insights into how fluid forces influence cell migration in confining environments, was recently published in Cell Reports. 

Warmest congratulations, Farshad, on achieving these remarkable milestones!
