Our paper, entitled ["Downregulation of YAP Activity Restricts P53 Hyperactivation to Promote Cell Survival in Confinement"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202302228) has been published in Advanced Science!ðŸŽ‰
 
This work integrates photopatterning with microfluidics to fabricate a novel high-throughput microchannel device that permits prolonged culture of single cells in physiologically relevant confined microenvironments. We found that constant exposure to confined microenvironments that deform the nucleus can reduce cell viability. However, YAP translocation to the cytoplasm helps cells adapt to confinement by reducing the frequency of nuclear envelope rupture events and preventing P53-mediated cell death.
  
Congrats to Farnaz Hemmati for leading this work! We extend our gratitude to our collaborators Sharon Gerecht, Vinicia Biancardi and Stelios Andreadis for their work and contributions!
