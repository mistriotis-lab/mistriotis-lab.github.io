The Mistriotis lab is very excited to receive funding from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation of Alabama (BCRFA). 
Our lab will investigate the integration of bioengineering tools, genome-wide genetic screens and in vivo models to discover new determinants of triple negative breast cancer cell invasion.
