# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

Our research lies at the interface of engineering biophysics, cell and molecular biology and biochemistry with applications in aging, vascular diseases and cancer metastasis. Our key contributions are: 1) the development of a method to reverse stem cell aging for vascular rejuvenation; 2) the discovery of intracellular mechanisms regulating cell mechanosensing in confinement; 3) the development of a reporter-based system for quantifying gene and pathway activation.
