Panagiotis Mistriotis, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Auburn University. He received his Diploma of Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (2007), his M.Sc degree in Human Biology from the University of Copenhagen (2010) and his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, SUNY (2016). His doctoral dissertation focused on developing novel strategies which reverse stem cell aging. Dr. Mistriotis pursued postdoctoral research in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at Johns Hopkins University (2016-2019). In his postdoctoral work, which was in part funded by an American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship, he integrated cutting-edge Î¼-fluidics, imaging, and molecular biology techniques with mathematical modeling to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating cancer cell locomotion inside confining microenvironments. He has published more than 20 peer-reviewed articles in premier journals such as Nature Reviews Cancer, Nature Biomedical Engineering, Science Advances, Journal of Cell Biology, etc.
